                    <h2>Getting started with Flowbite</h2>
                    <p>First of all you need to understand how Flowbite works. This library is not another framework.
                        Rather, it is a set of components based on Tailwind CSS that you can just copy-paste from the
                        documentation.</p>
                    <p>It also includes a JavaScript file that enables interactive components, such as modals, dropdowns,
                        and datepickers which you can optionally include into your project via CDN or NPM.</p>
                    <p>You can check out the <a href="https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/">quickstart
                            guide</a> to explore the elements by including the CDN files into your project. But if you want
                        to build a project with Flowbite I recommend you to follow the build tools steps so that you can
                        purge and minify the generated CSS.</p>
                    <p>You'll also receive a lot of useful application UI, marketing UI, and e-commerce pages that can help
                        you get started with your projects even faster. You can check out this <a
                            href="https://flowbite.com/docs/components/tables/">comparison table</a> to better understand
                        the differences between the open-source and pro version of Flowbite.</p>
                    <h2>When does design come in handy?</h2>
                    <p>While it might seem like extra work at a first glance, here are some key moments in which prototyping
                        will come in handy:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Usability testing</strong>. Does your user know how to exit out of screens? Can they
                            follow your intended user journey and buy something from the site you’ve designed? By running a
                            usability test, you’ll be able to see how users will interact with your design once it’s live;
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Involving stakeholders</strong>. Need to check if your GDPR consent boxes are displaying
                            properly? Pass your prototype to your data protection team and they can test it for real;</li>
                        <li><strong>Impressing a client</strong>. Prototypes can help explain or even sell your idea by
                            providing your client with a hands-on experience;</li>
                        <li><strong>Communicating your vision</strong>. By using an interactive medium to preview and test
                            design elements, designers and developers can understand each other — and the project — better.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Laying the groundwork for best design</h3>
                    <p>Before going digital, you might benefit from scribbling down some ideas in a sketchbook. This way,
                        you can think things through before committing to an actual design project.</p>
                    <p>Let's start by including the CSS file inside the <code>head</code> tag of your HTML.</p>
                    <h3>Understanding typography</h3>
                    <h4>Type properties</h4>
                    <p>A typeface is a collection of letters. While each letter is unique, certain shapes are shared across
                        letters. A typeface represents shared patterns across a collection of letters.</p>

                    <h3>Type classification</h3>
                    <h4>Serif</h4>
                    <p>A serif is a small shape or projection that appears at the beginning or end of a stroke on a letter.
                        Typefaces with serifs are called serif typefaces. Serif fonts are classified as one of the
                        following:</p>
                    <h4>Old-Style serifs</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Low contrast between thick and thin strokes</li>
                        <li>Diagonal stress in the strokes</li>
                        <li>Slanted serifs on lower-case ascenders</li>
                    </ul><img src="https://flowbite.s3.amazonaws.com/typography-plugin/typography-image-2.png" alt="" />

                        <li>Diagonal stress in the strokes</li>
                        <li>Slanted serifs on lower-case ascenders</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Laying the best for successful prototyping</h3>
                    <p>A serif is a small shape or projection that appears at the beginning:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Flowbite is just awesome. It contains tons of predesigned components and pages starting from
                            login screen to complex dashboard. Perfect choice for your next SaaS application.</p>
