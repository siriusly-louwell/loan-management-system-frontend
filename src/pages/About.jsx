          <h2>Getting started with Flowbite</h2>
          <p>
            First of all you need to understand how Flowbite works. This library
            is not another framework. Rather, it is a set of components based on
            Tailwind CSS that you can just copy-paste from the documentation.
          </p>
          <p>
            It also includes a JavaScript file that enables interactive
            components, such as modals, dropdowns, and datepickers which you can
            optionally include into your project via CDN or NPM.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can check out the{" "}
            <a href="https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/">
              quickstart guide
            </a>{" "}
            to explore the elements by including the CDN files into your
            project. But if you want to build a project with Flowbite I
            recommend you to follow the build tools steps so that you can purge
            and minify the generated CSS.
          </p>
          <p>
            You'll also receive a lot of useful application UI, marketing UI,
            and e-commerce pages that can help you get started with your
            projects even faster. You can check out this{" "}

            to better understand the differences between the open-source and pro
            version of Flowbite.

          <h2>When does design come in handy?</h2>
          <p>
            While it might seem like extra work at a first glance, here are some
            key moments in which prototyping will come in handy:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Usability testing</strong>. Does your user know how to
              exit out of screens? Can they follow your intended user journey
              and buy something from the site you’ve designed? By running a
              usability test, you’ll be able to see how users will interact with
              your design once it’s live;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Involving stakeholders</strong>. Need to check if your
              GDPR consent boxes are displaying properly? Pass your prototype to
              your data protection team and they can test it for real;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Impressing a client</strong>. Prototypes can help explain
              or even sell your idea by providing your client with a hands-on
              experience;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Communicating your vision</strong>. By using an
              interactive medium to preview and test design elements, designers
              and developers can understand each other — and the project —
              better.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Laying the groundwork for best design</h3>
          <p>
            Before going digital, you might benefit from scribbling down some
            ideas in a sketchbook. This way, you can think things through before
            committing to an actual design project.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's start by including the CSS file inside the <code>head</code>{" "}
            tag of your HTML.
          </p>
          <h3>Understanding typography</h3>
          <h4>Type properties</h4>
          <p>
            A typeface is a collection of letters. While each letter is unique,
            certain shapes are shared across letters. A typeface represents
            shared patterns across a collection of letters.
          </p>
          <h4>Baseline</h4>

          <h3>Type classification</h3>
          <h4>Serif</h4>
          <p>
            A serif is a small shape or projection that appears at the beginning
            or end of a stroke on a letter. Typefaces with serifs are called
            serif typefaces. Serif fonts are classified as one of the following:
          </p>
          <h4>Old-Style serifs</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Low contrast between thick and thin strokes</li>
            <li>Diagonal stress in the strokes</li>
            <li>Slanted serifs on lower-case ascenders</li>
          </ul>
          <img
            src="https://flowbite.s3.amazonaws.com/typography-plugin/typography-image-2.png"
            alt=""
          />
          <ol>
            <li>Low contrast between thick and thin strokes</li>
            <li>Diagonal stress in the strokes</li>
            <li>Slanted serifs on lower-case ascenders</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Laying the best for successful prototyping</h3>
          <p>
            A serif is a small shape or projection that appears at the
            beginning:

              Flowbite is just awesome. It contains tons of predesigned
              components and pages starting from login screen to complex
              dashboard. Perfect choice for your next SaaS application.
            </p>

          <h4>Code example</h4>
